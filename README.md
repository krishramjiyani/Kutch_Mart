For your Kutch Mart clothing e-commerce website focusing on handicraft products, here are some changes tailored to reflect the unique aspects of your project:

### 1. **Technology Stack**:
   - **MongoDB**: Use MongoDB to store product details that emphasize the uniqueness of Kutch handicrafts, such as traditional motifs, origin, artisan information, and materials used.
   - **React.js**: Leverage React to build a vibrant and visually appealing user interface that highlights handicraft products. Use carousels, featured categories, and storytelling elements to immerse users in the Kutch culture.
   - **Node.js and Express.js**: Utilize these to handle backend operations, including managing a dynamic product catalog that reflects stock levels and limited-edition items unique to handcrafted goods.

### 2. **Product Management and Database**:
   - Modify the MongoDB schema to include fields specific to handicrafts, such as artisan name, origin region, and craft type. For Kutch-specific handicrafts, you could add filters by material (e.g., cotton, silk), craft style (e.g., embroidery, block printing), and exclusivity (e.g., limited edition).
   
### 3. **User Experience Features**:
   - **Product Catalog**: Organize products by unique categories like "Traditional Kutch Wear," "Home Decor," and "Jewelry," to appeal to users interested in the cultural aspect of Kutch handicrafts.
   - **Product Recommendations**: Integrate personalized recommendations that showcase Kutch-specific designs, based on a user's browsing history, to encourage cross-category discovery.

### 4. **Shopping Cart and Checkout**:
   - Emphasize the authenticity of products during checkout with details such as "Handcrafted in Kutch" or "Limited Edition." Provide a donation option to support artisans, if applicable.

### 5. **Inventory and Availability**:
   - Implement real-time inventory updates, with indicators for items in high demand or those that are handcrafted in limited batches.

### 6. **Wishlist and Favorites**:
   - Allow users to curate "Favorites" from unique Kutch handicrafts, adding a personal touch for products they want to revisit. Integrate options to share these wishlists on social media to generate interest in Kutch culture.

### 7. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - **Scalability**: Design the website to handle increased seasonal traffic, especially during festivals or local holidays, when demand for handicraft products may surge.
   - **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure the UI is culturally immersive, with vibrant themes and colors reminiscent of Kutch artwork, helping convey the authenticity of the handicrafts.
  
These adjustments can help ensure that Kutch Mart aligns with its mission to promote Kutch handicrafts, supporting artisans while offering a unique and culturally immersive experience for users.
